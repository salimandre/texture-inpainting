**Inpainting** is the task of **recovering** a missing region of an image. This region is called a **masked region**. The paper we followed propose an inpainting method in the case of texture images. In this framework texture images are supposed to be a **random gaussian field**. Authors used the work of Julesz, on the **translation invariance** of textures statistics, to model and estimate the variance of this gaussian vector. Masked region is then recovered by **conditional simulation**.
